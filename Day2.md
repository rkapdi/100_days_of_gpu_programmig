#Debugging the Cmake problem
- Reinstalled VS & Cmake which did not solve the problem.
- Tried using Glitter to get started and not have to deal with compiling and linking libraries.
- Glitter got me facing the same Cmake error :') *all hope lost, no shortcuts in life*
- Reinstalling Windows to get a fresh start.
